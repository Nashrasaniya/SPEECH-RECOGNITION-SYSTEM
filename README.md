Speech Recognition System

This project is a comprehensive solution that converts spoken words into text. It leverages pre-trained models and libraries to facilitate seamless speech-to-text transcription. Designed for tasks such as transcribing short audio clips, it serves as a foundational tool for various applications in natural language processing and human-computer interaction.

# Features

      -> Speech-to-Text (STT): Transcribes audio files into text using the SpeechRecognition library.

      -> Audio Format Conversion: Utilizes pydub and ffmpeg to convert audio files between formats (e.g., MP3 to WAV).

      -> Command-Line Interface: Provides an interactive CLI for user input and output.

      -> Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems

# Technologies Used
   
      -> Python 3.11: Core programming language.

      -> SpeechRecognition: Library for performing speech recognition.

      -> pydub: Library for audio manipulation.

      -> ffmpeg: Tool for handling multimedia data.

# Usage:
   
     i. Convert MP3 to WAV:
  
         -> python converr.py

            Ensure the MP3 file path is correctly specified within the script.

     ii. Transcribe Audio to Text:

        ->  python speech_to_text.py
  
            The script will process the WAV file and output the transcribed text.

# Example

      Input Audio: A short WAV file containing speech.

      Transcribed Text: The script will output the text equivalent of the spoken words in the audio file.
