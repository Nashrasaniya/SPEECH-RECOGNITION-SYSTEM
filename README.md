Speech Recognition System

This project is a comprehensive solution that converts spoken words into text. It leverages pre-trained models and libraries to facilitate seamless speech-to-text transcription. Designed for tasks such as transcribing short audio clips, it serves as a foundational tool for various applications in natural language processing and human-computer interaction.

1. Features

-> Speech-to-Text (STT): Transcribes audio files into text using the SpeechRecognition library.

-> Audio Format Conversion: Utilizes pydub and ffmpeg to convert audio files between formats (e.g., MP3 to WAV).

-> Command-Line Interface: Provides an interactive CLI for user input and output.

-> Cross-Platform Compatibility: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems

2. Technologies Used
   
-> Python 3.11: Core programming language.

-> SpeechRecognition: Library for performing speech recognition.

-> pydub: Library for audio manipulation.

-> ffmpeg: Tool for handling multimedia data.

3. Usage:
   
  i. Convert MP3 to WAV:
  
-> python converr.py

   Ensure the MP3 file path is correctly specified within the script.

  ii. Transcribe Audio to Text:

  ->  python speech_to_text.py
  
   The script will process the WAV file and output the transcribed text.

4. Example

Input Audio: A short WAV file containing speech.

Transcribed Text: The script will output the text equivalent of the spoken words in the audio file.
